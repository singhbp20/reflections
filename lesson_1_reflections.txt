How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows difference between two files using diff command.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    It will show me all the progress I made over time in different components. In
	addition I can see what went wrong before I did any bad commits.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    pros:
		- Know when to commit based on feature or workspace
	
	cons:
		- Needs to remember each time when to commit so that it can't before
		  too big

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To logically keep tracks of changes with dependents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    First use "git log" to view all the changes visually in terms of message logged
	then use "git diff" to view specific changes from the previous version of the file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    This will let us fix the future updates with previousely stored history

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Start coding complicating projects using GIT tool.
