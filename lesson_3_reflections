When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When work is being split into multiple peoples/locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This way i can track when i need to update my local with updated stuff so that
	i always have working code.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks - when taking someone's work for modification purposes
	clones - cloning on local computer for extensive modification
	branches - working locally on different features so that its easier to test and see

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	This way merging two states becomes lot easier without worrying about how remote branch is
	way different
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	Its depends on the type of work. Simple word doc can be accomplished using google docs...
	but SVN might also work in this case.
