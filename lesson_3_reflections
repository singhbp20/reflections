When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When work is being split into multiple peoples/locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This way i can track when i need to update my local with updated stuff so that
	i always have working code.
